# ng2-examples
A collection of basic to advance examples that I am going to create while learning angular2 framework, some from the official documentation i.e. [angular.io](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) and some from [ng-book2] (https://www.ng-book.com/2/)

###Check-out Examples
We can check out and play with these examples on the local machine, by doing following steps.
- Install `node` and `npm` from node.org .
- `clone` this repo by running `clone https://github.com/shahzadns/ng2-examples.git` command on Terminal or Command prompt.
- `cd` to project directory and example sub directory.
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- check out the local server on `localhost:3000`


Cheers!
